### Hello world 🌎


#### I am an Infrastructure Engineer by day and an Open Source contributor by night.


Senior DevOps Engineer at [Apollo.io](https://apollo.io);<br>
Maintain [push-to-gcr-github-action](https://github.com/RafikFarhad/push-to-gcr-github-action), [clang-format-github-action](https://github.com/RafikFarhad/clang-format-github-action);<br>
Contributed to a few OSS projects including [kubernetes/dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard), [publish-unit-test-result-action](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action) and so on.


- 🪚 ️I use daily: `.rb`, `.bash`, `.go`, `.py`, `.yaml`
- 🤓 I read a lot of codes from the OSS community
- 🛠️ I built an Online Judge System when I was a university student, unfortunately, that is not live now. I am very enthusiastic about competitive programming.
- 📌 Like every engineer, I have a lot of side-projects, but I never finish them. Ping me if you want to collaborate on something.
